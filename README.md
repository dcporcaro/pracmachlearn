# pracmachlearn

This repository is for me to submit the course project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning class, a part of the Data Science Curriculum

There should be an html file with my writeup, a folder of files supporting the html, and an R Markdown file.  There is also a gh-pages bracnh to allow fellow students to review the html file via github.
